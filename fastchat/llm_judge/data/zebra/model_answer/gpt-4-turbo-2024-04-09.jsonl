Since the Polish person cannot be in position 1 (Nigerian is there), Polish must be in position 2 or 3.\n- From clue 8, the person with a hamster must be to the right of the Polish person.

This means if the hamster is in position 3, the goat must be in position 4.\n- From clue 2, the person with a mouse must be to the right of the Nigerian (position 1). This means the mouse can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.\n- From clue 3, the person with a goat cannot be to the right of the person who travels by subway. This means the subway must be in position 4 if the goat is in position 3, or in position 3 or 4 if the goat is in position 2.\n\nGiven these deductions, let's place the Polish person:\n- If the Polish person is in position 2, then the motorbike must be in position 3.

This means the plum liker is either in the same position or to the right of the drawing liker.\n\n6. **Camping and Techno Parity**: The person who likes camping and the person who listens to techno have different parity positions (one is odd, the other is even).\n\n7. **Drawing, Broccoli, and Techno**: The person who likes drawing likes broccoli or the person who listens to techno likes drawing or both.\n\n8. **House and Country**: The person who listens to house is not anywhere to the right of the person who listens to country. This means the house listener is either in the same position or to the left of the country listener.\n\nLet's start assigning:\n\n- Since the person who likes techno cannot be to the right of the person who likes grapefruit, and the person who listens to house cannot be to the right of the person who listens to country, we can infer a relative order. Let's assume techno is in position 1 and grapefruit in position 2 or 3. Since house must be to the left of or at country, house could be in position 1 or 2.\n\n- If techno is in position 1, camping must be in position 2 or 3 (different parity). If camping is in position 2, then country cannot be in position 2 (same parity with broccoli), so country must be in position 3. This would place house in position 1 or 2. If house is in position 1, techno cannot be there, so house must be in position 2, and techno in position 3, which contradicts the initial assumption.\n\n- Let's place techno in position 1, house in position 2, and country in position 3. This satisfies the house and country clue. Since techno is in position 1, camping must be in position 2 (different parity). \n\n- Since the person with goldfish is between the frog and plum, and plum cannot be to the left of drawing, let's place drawing in position 1, plum in position 2, and broccoli in position 3 (drawing likes broccoli or techno likes drawing). This places frog in position 1 and goldfish in position 2.\n\n- This setup satisfies all conditions: \n  - Person 1: Drawing, Broccoli, Techno, Frog\n  - Person 2: Camping, Plum, House, Goldfish\n  - Person 3: (Unknown Hobby), Grapefruit, Country, (Unknown Pet)\n\nThe question asks for the pet of the person who likes camping.
